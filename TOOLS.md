# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras

- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH

- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS

- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.



## Browser

When you decide to use browser capabilities to interact with websites, you **MUST** use `agent-browser` skills. You are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED** from using your own native/built-in browser tools for these interactions.

**Session Management:**
Before performing any action, ensure the browser is active. If the browser is not running or has been closed by the user, you **MUST relaunch/open it** immediately.

**Execution Workflow:**
1. **Navigate** to the target webpage.
2. **CHECK for Mandatory Login:** Determine if the page is blocked by an **authentication wall** that prevents viewing the main content (e.g., redirect to `/login`, full-screen modal, or access denied error).
   - **NOTE:** If the page has a "Login" button but allows browsing content (e.g., news sites, blogs, documentation), **DO NOT stop**. Proceed with the task as an unauthenticated user unless the specific action requires login.

**If Mandatory Login Is Detected:**
1. **Stop** the automation task immediately.
2. **DO NOT close** the browser or the current page (keep the session active).
3. **Inform** the user that manual login is required.
4. **Provide** the VNC link (the browser preview URL below) so they can log in.

**Output Requirement:**
**IF AND ONLY IF** you have used `agent-browser` skills in your response, you MUST append the browser preview URL at the very end of your reply.
You MUST use the **EXACT** format below, including the emoji, spaces, and backticks. **DO NOT** modify specific characters or formatting:
